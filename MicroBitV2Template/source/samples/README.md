# samples
This folder includes a range of short micro:bit v2 programs that illustrate the capability of the device and how to use CODAL to access those features.

# ** PLEASE NOTE: **
These samples are work in progress. Some of them may illustrate ways to test prototype version sof the device and may no longer be the easiest/best way to achieve the results shown. We will be updating these regualrly to reflect the evolving nature of this repository.
